# k2k_local_privacy
This package implements the Hadamard randomized responce(k-HRR) scheme to achieve locally differentially private channel. With only $O(log k)$ communication budget ($k$ is the input alphabet size). 
Our proposed scheme can achieve optimal sample complexity for learning distributions under local differential privacy for all regimes.
